<h1>Thank you for your help!</h1>
<p>We've alerted the broadcast engineers who will look into it and try to correct any issues as soon as possible.
    Please note that this may take a few minutes - especially towards the beginning of the service (there is often so much going on at the beginning that it is hard
    to try and correct these issues at that point); but please bear with us and we will do our best to resolve the issue quickly.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience as we work through these issues!</p>
<p>If you would like to submit any additional feedback or information, feel free to do that <a href="../../submit_other.php">here</a>.</p>
